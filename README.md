# Advent of Code
these are my scripts and or functions for solving the advent of code problems (I started working on these in 2020). As you might note, I have tried to work with a consistent language and pushed myself to solve these puzzles with minimal reliance on external packages and libraries (but may relent on this for the tougher challenges). These solutions are 'quick and dirty', and so are not robust to inputs beyond those for the challenges. This was purely as a fun challenge, but is one of many ways I have tried to improve my approaches to problem solving via coding.
