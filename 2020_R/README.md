# Advent of Code 2020

For 2020 I have used R (and tried to stick only with base R to boot). I used R 4.x so there may be some parts of scripts where the dreaeded stringsasfactor needs to be set to run in R 3.x as I haven't been strict in ensuring this is correct for me. Some of the solutions are very much applicable only to the specific input, and in fact are unlikely to work for less 'nice' examples (eg day 16). I have put a fcous on trying to solve the problems whilst also including some checking and protection against edge cases, but these haven't generally been tested on anything other than the examples given on the problem description pages. I also haven't optimised the code for most days, and tend to only build the code with this in mind if I expect the solutions to have a large amount of recursion or iteration (and even then if the data was 'small' enough I tended not to worry). Feel free to get in touch if you see anything interesting or have suggestions for ways to solve the problems more neatly (without using packages outside of the base R environment). I'd be very keen to hear a better way to solve day 14, which involved writing a lot of value converstion by hand because of the lack of long ints in base R.

I chose R for my first year in this challenge as it happened to be open when I came across the AoC (I was using it for some statistical modelling and plotting for my PhD).
